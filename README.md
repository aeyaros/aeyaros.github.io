# New Website Design

My previous website design was initially created right after I changed my major from architecture to computer science. At the time, I just needed to display the PDF file I made that contained my architectural design projects. This use case only required a simple design with a header, a footer, and an embedded PDF at the center. 

The website started to grow in complexity as the months and years passed. I added more and more links in the footer, replaced the PDF embed with a slideshow, and made a thousand other visual tweaks and changes. After a certain point, the code had become fairly bloated, and this made the website difficult to debug.

Thus, it was time for me to start from scratch. I'm hoping this new design will be much more elegant while retaining the visual style I've been working to perfect over the past four years.
