# New Website Design

My current website design was initially created right after I changed my major from architecture to computer science. At the time, I just needed to display the PDF document I made that contained my architectural design projects. This use case only required a simple design with a header, a footer, and an embedded PDF at the center. 

The website started to grow in complexity as the months and years passed. I added more and more links in the footer, I replaced the PDF embed with a slideshow, I added mouseover effects on the slideshow area when hovering over the footer links, and made a thousand other visual tweaks and changes.

Naturally, after adding so much to it, the website's code has become bloated and complex. As a consequence, it's much harder to debug. Thus, it's time for me to start from scratch. I'm hoping this new design will be much more elegant while retaining the visual style I've been working to perfect over the past four years.
